typical pasta dish of centre of italy, with guanciale (pillow), onions, tomato puree  
usually for each sauce we have a different format of pasta, with amatriciana sauce is typical to eat _bucatini_, but I think that also all the large pasta format are good with it, like _paccheri_, _schiaffoni_, _calamarata_ or _conchiglioni_.
