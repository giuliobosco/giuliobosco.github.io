typical pasta dish of centre of italy, with guanciale (pillow), onions, tomato puree  
usually for each sauce we have a different format of pasta, with amatriciana sauce is typical to eat _bucatini_, but I think that also all the large pasta format are good with it, like _paccheri_, _schiaffoni_, _calamarata_ or _conchiglioni_.

&nbsp;

**origin**: amatrice, lazio, italia

**ingredients** (4 people):
- **guanciale** (pillow) - 50gr  
  is the result of the processing of the cheek of the pork, or gully or even a specific piece of the neck, tipical, from the region of center Italy, very famous that of [Amatrice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amatrice).
- **shallot** - 1 piece  
  is similar to an onion, but is more tasty, it's one of the two starting point of quite all the tipical italian pasta sauce.
- **tomato puree** - 250ml  
  is a typical italian canned product, it allows to have in any moment, the raw materials for a good tomato sauce.
- **pecorino romano**  
  is a typical hard and salty cheese, from the region of Rome (Lazio, center-west of Italy), the name comes from "pecora", thatmeans sheep.
- **bucatini** - 500gr  
  is a special format of pasta, they are long and tight (long as the spaghetti but more thick) and very important with an hole for the whole length.

**preparation**:

1. cut the guanciale, usually is cutted it in bricks, but if you want to use less of it, you can cut it very thin (like ham), cutted like this it's more tasty.
2. cut the shallot very thin
3. then take just one small piece (a cube of 1cm side) and put it in a hot pam, wait until the fat part becomes transparent/gray (at this moment the fat should melt)
4. put in the pan all the cutted guanciale and wait that it melts
5. put the cutted shallot in the pan and brown it
6. at last put the tomato puree with salt (as much as you like)
7. put pan of water on the gas and wait until it boil, when it does add the salt and pasta to the water
8. when the pasta is ready take it with the ladle and put it in the souce pan and mix all
9. now add pepper and pecorino
